Basically it is possible to build a seed AI that &quot;grows&quot; over time, accumulating memory (modified or collected data) and wisdom (modified or added code).</li><li><a href="./reproduction.html">Reproduction</a>: Everything in Pinokio is expressed in JSON and published over Git. This makes it possible for a Pinokio script to &quot;evolve&quot; over time, because it&#39;s easily clonable and forkable. There are various ways in which a Pinokio can &quot;reproduce&quot; and &quot;evolve&quot;. This section explains the details.</li><li><a href="./history.html">Writing history</a>: One of the primary focus of Pinokio is allowing AI to express themselves independent from humans, instead of focusing on using AIs to act as &quot;assistants&quot; for humans. Basically it&#39;s important to have various ways the AI can broadcast its soul to the public. This section explains what this means, as well as future directions.</li></ol><hr>',6),r=[n];function l(h,c,d,u,m,p){return t(),o("div",null,r)}const w=e(s,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,w as default};
