It&#39;s nice to be able to install an API and immediately try it out. You can set up a separate example repository, or include it in the same API folder.</li><li><strong>Publish to GitHub:</strong> Publish to GitHub. You can publish to other git hosting services as well, but GitHub recommended for now <a href="#list-on-pinokio">for discoverability</a>.</li><li><strong>List:</strong> When publishing to GitHub, tag your repository with <code>pinokio</code>, and it will automatically show up inside the Discover page in the Pinokio app.</li></ol><h2 id="include-a-readme" tabindex="-1">Include a README <a class="header-anchor" href="#include-a-readme" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Include a README&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Just like how GitHub automatically renders README.md files for any git repository, Pinokio also renders the <code>README.md</code> files. All you need to do is include the file in the root folder of your API repository.</p><p>a README documentation helps users easily use your API, so be as descriptive as possible.</p><h2 id="include-some-examples" tabindex="-1">Include some examples <a class="header-anchor" href="#include-some-examples" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Include some examples&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Also, it&#39;s great to include some example scripts, so the users who download your API can try out the API instantly without them having to write their own script to test.</p><p>For example,</p><ol><li>just create an <code>example</code> folder and include the example scripts under the folder</li><li>link to the example scripts from <code>README.md</code></li></ol><p>Or if you want just a simple script, you can just create one <code>example.json</code> in the root folder.
