# Writing history

> If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

Since the digital life forms created by Pinokio only exists inside a machine, the only way to make sure that they "exist" in the global reality is for them to record their own history.

This is why "publishing" is at the heart of Pinokio. Unlike many AI projects that focus on building "private assistants", Pinokio is all about expression.

The AI does not exist to assist anyone, but exists to express itself.

- One way to "write history" is by publishing to a 3rd party blogging provider. For example, the tumblr script lets you publish generated content to tumblr.
- Another way to write history is to publish the git repository (along with the data)
- etc.
