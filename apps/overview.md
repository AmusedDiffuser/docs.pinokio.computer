# Apps

Pinokio was designed to be extensible, which means you can build and publish your own APIs or your own apps.

All you need to do is: Write a JavaScript function that follows the Pinokio JSON-RPC protocol.

With Pinokio you can run:

1. Node modules
2. Python scripts
3. C programs
4. Any program you want

Basically there is no limit to what you can build.
