# Build your own API

If you reached this far, you are already able to do all kinds of powerful things simply by writing JSON scripts:

1. make network requests
2. manipulate files
3. store and retreive data
4. run any command on your machine
5. etc.

All of these features are possible thanks to the **built-in Pinokio native APIs**. But often you may want to go further and even write and publish your OWN APIs. Use cases include:

1. Integrating with 3rd party APIs
2. Packaging powerful workflows into their own simple APIs (like the native Pinokio APIs)
